What this Module does is to make sure you enter a 'Unique' Internal Reference (default_code) for your Products. It includes an 'Alert! Message' that pops up when you enter a code that is already in use. Does your 'Internal Reference' field disappear when you update the product Attributes? This Module also saves a backup of the Internal Reference in a field below, so you still have a copy if it disappears.
